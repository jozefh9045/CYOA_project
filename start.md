You feel extremely tired. Your eyes are closed and you can smell what seems to   
be a dense frost around you. It smells like the morning dew in the out doors. 

You are very tired and you do not want to open your eyes. You want to keep  
sleeping. However you do not know where you are and you also feel like investigating.
