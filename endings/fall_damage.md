##Fall Damage Ending
---
You decide to take your chances with the water down bellow. You jump down however   
you have made your last decision. The stream was less than three feet deep and   
your body took the full impact of the dirt beneath the water.  You shatter your   
spine and your right shoulder bone. You are not capable of pushing  yourself out  
of the water. You hold your breath and struggle but you can no longer feel anything  
beneath your chest. Your lungs force you to release you breath and you can feel   
the water seeping into your lungs. Your eyes slowly close.
