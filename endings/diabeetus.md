##Diabeetus Ending
---
You decide to not go one any further. You sit down, rest and pick up a rock.   
Then pop it into your mouth. To your surprise, the rock tastes amazing. You   
pick up another and pop it into your mouth. You can't stop eating them. 

After about a few hours, you get can no longer move. Your body will not let you.  
You just keep eating. you have become a couch potato without a couch. After a  
day or two, you get diabeetus.

(congratulations)
