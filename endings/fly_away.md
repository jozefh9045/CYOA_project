##Fly Away Ending
---
You decide to take the hot air balloon up the mountain. Maybe you can make it to  
the other side and go back home. if you go high enough you may even be able to   
find out where you are. So you start to light the fire and inflate the balloon.   
You get into the basket and wait as the balloon rises. You go higher and higher.   
The wind also starts to get more intense. You are nervous as you pass some rigged   
rocks in the almost vertical incline. 

After what seems like hours you pass over the mountain. You can see the sun setting   
and a beautiful red horizon. The clouds are also not every high over your head   
anymore. You feel free like you can go anywhere. Suddenly, a huge gush of wind   
hits the balloon and knocks your over. Your head hits the basket  and you lay on   
the bottom. It takes you a moment to regain your senses. 

You just regained your memories.....
