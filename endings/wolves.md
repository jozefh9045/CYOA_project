##Wolves Ending
---
After a while, you have decided to keep your eyes closed. You don’t want to open  
them because you are tired. It doesn’t matter if this is really a forest, it’s   
probably a Monday and there is no reason to open your eyes or even wake up in   
the matter. 

Over time you realize you can’t fall back asleep. You hear faint howls in the   
distance and soft but aggressive growls near you. Who cares about that right?   
It might be a Monday and you might be in a forest. You don’t have to go to school;   
you don’t have to go to work. You just relax.

The wolves apparently don’t like you sleeping here……
