##Cave's End
---
You are staring to grow desperate. The cave seems to be never ending. The only   
things you can see are the glowing rocks on the ground. You start to pick up you  
pace and run though the cave. 

Finally, you stop. You see a drop off in front of you. you look down and see that  
the drop is very very high. You can also see a small stream running down another  
small path down below. You are left with the decisions to jump down into the   
uncertain water or stay put. If you stay put you can also try the candy rocks in  
the ground.
