##Hot Air Balloon
---
You decide that you have come too far to turn back now. There is no need for you   
to go to back to that dead forest. So you continue to walk toward the mountain.

As you moved forward, you heart skipped a beat. your previous intuition was correct.   
This mountain is a dead end. You look up and see the sheer steepness of the gigantic   
rocky structure. You are torn and you do not know where to go now. So you must   
improvise to survive this experience alive. You frantically look around for anything   
you can do to maybe climb this mountain. To your surprise you find between two   
giant boulders, a deflated hot air balloon with fuel next to it. As you walk towards   
it you see a short drop off. You see the thin forest and a cave down below.   
You  can easily use the fuel  to light a fire and inflate the hot air balloon     
make the jump down to get to the cave or you can take your chances with the steep     
mountains.
