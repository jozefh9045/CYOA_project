##Mountain
---
You decide to take the left path and move forward. To your luck, the dark and   
eerie forest starts to get thinner. Lots of light starts to come into it. Finally,   
you escape the forest. You completely leave it behind. The only traces of a forest   
that seems to be around you are a few trees. You look up and you can see what   
seems to you like a dead end. You see a gigantic mountain. You don't think it is   
crossable. You don't know if you should move forward or go back. 

[Go back because that mountain is definitely a dead end](forest.md)   

[Keep moving forward because you have come to far to turn back now.](hot_air_balloon.md)
