##Open Eyes
---
You _intelligently_ decide to open your eyes because.... well you just woke up in   
a random forest. Who wouldn't open their eyes? So you stand up and look around.   
The thick green and dark forest seemed to be all around you. Your clothes are   
ripped and the chilly breeze moving through the trees makes you shiver. You hear   
an eerie howl  in the distance but you can't see what is making it because the   
undergrowth is so think full of plants and roots. So with nowhere else to go, you   
decide to walk forward into what seems like an opening in the under growth.
